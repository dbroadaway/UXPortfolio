        I'm Danielle Broadaway. I've worked in the User Experience Design Space
        for over 15 years. Over a million people have use products that I have
        designed (Yep, I keep score) I always remember that problems need to be
        solved and objects are meant to be

            My design philosophy is user driven, simple, and pragmatic.

        <p>
          Design is essentially problem solving. I like to understand as much
          about the challenge as possible before iterating on a UX solution.
          Deep knowledge of the problem informs every aspect of my design
          process from creation through each design iteration. User research can
          be challenging. I have conducted user tests at coffee shops, getting
          quick feedback for the price of a gift card. The UX wall at a user
          conference allowed me to pull users in for a quick interview. Steve
          Krug’s DIY user testing process was part of the sprint cycle. Sales,
          customer service and support departments can always provide direct
          user feedback.

        <p>
          Coco Chanel famously said, “before you leave the house, look in the
          mirror and take at least one thing off.” I take the same approach to
          UX and Product Design. Core features should be obvious and immediately
          available. Ancillary features should be easy find to but should not
          obstruct core features. Visual Design should enhance the experience
          without being disruptive. I always ask myself is this necessary,
          useful, or valuable?
        </p>
        <p>
          Product design must be informed by user needs, technical limitations,
          business constraints, and efficient process. As a product designer I
          put myself in the shoes of the user, the client, the developer, and
          other stakeholders as I advocate for the most pragmatic solution to a
          design problem.
