                    My design philosophy is user driven, simple, and pragmatic.

        <p>
            Design is essentially problem solving. I like to understand as much about the challenge as possible
            before iterating on a UX solution. Deep knowledge of the problem informs every aspect of my design
            process from creation through each design iteration. User research can be challenging. I have conducted user
            tests at
            coffee shops, getting quick feedback for the price of a gift card. The UX wall at a user conference allowed
            me to pull users
            in for a quick interview. Steve Krug’s DIY user testing process was part of the sprint cycle. Sales,
            customer service and support
            departments can always provide direct user feedback.
        </p>
        <p> Coco Chanel famously said, “before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take at least one thing
            off.” I take the same approach to UX and Product Design. Core features should be obvious and immediately
            available. Ancillary features should be easy find to but should not obstruct core features. Visual
            Design should enhance the experience without being disruptive. I always ask myself is this necessary,
            useful, or valuable?
        </p>
        <p>Product design must be informed by user needs, technical limitations, business constraints, and
        efficient process. As a product designer I put myself in the shoes of the user, the client, the developer,
        and other stakeholders as I advocate for the most pragmatic solution to a design problem.
